# Custom Integrations Market

Downie 4.4 introduces Custom Integrations Market which is a free community-supported market with custom integrations for sites that are not directly supported by Downie. Any user can submit an integration they've written to be included in the market listing - and any user can download any of the approved submissions (for free).

## Downloading Integrations

You can use the "Add" button in Preferences > Custom Integrations to browse integrations available and install them. Please keep in mind that installing any of the integrations you agree that you understand that while the integrations are reviewed and tested, they are community-supported, meaning that there's no official support for them and the author of Downie is not responsible for any potential damages caused by using these integrations. All of the integrations consist of JavaScript code that is run within the context of the webpage the integration handles. The source code for the integration is available and can be reviewed.

## Submitting Integrations

If you've written a custom integration and would like to submit it, please use the Submit button in Preferences > Custom Integrations. Any integrations are very welcome and will be reviewed. The review process is done manually and reviews that the support is not for a site with illegal or hateful content.

While you are more than welcome to include your credits in the comment of the submission, the submission will become part of the Github repository - this means that all of the integrations are freely available to anyone and can be updated or modified by anyone.

## Updating Integrations

If the integration stops working for you and you have made a fix, please re-submit it. The change will be reviewed and the integration will be updated. Downie updates automatically all integrations.

## FAQ

### How do I write a custom integration?

See the article about custom integrations. Note that some JavaScript and HTML knowledge may be required (code-less matching is only available on macOS 14 or later).

### Why don't you just support that site right away?

Downie integrates with many different sites, but for many reasons, it cannot integrate with all of them. Some sites are for members only, or for a very specific group of users. Such sites are usually supported by the User-Guided Extraction, but could be automated via custom integrations.

### You have rejected my integration. Why?

The developer of Downie reserves the right to reject integrations for sites that (for example, but not limited to) promote violence, racism or hatred; infringe copyright or otherwise violate international laws.
